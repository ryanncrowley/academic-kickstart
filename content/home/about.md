# Biography

I have over sixteen years of experience, as an analyst providing support for several investigators and projects, the content area of my research is diverse. My role in these collaborations is to champion the methodological and analytical needs of the project.  My research is predominately quantitative and questionnaire based, and more recently, these methods are accompanied with time-event based observation, peer network, and intensive longitudinal data (ILD).  I enjoy bringing innovative methodology and novel assessment procedures to a proposal to quantify previously unmeasurable phenomena.  Research content areas that I have contributed to include: parenting practices, tobacco cessation, and adolescent problem behaviors.  Longitudinal investigations and prevention programs I have assisted are focused on delaying the initiation or escalation of substance use and reducing the participation of risky sexual practices that accompany a substance-abusing lifestyle.  I find these research areas intrinsically and extrinsically motivating, as I provide innovative methods and analysis to projects that have the potential to improve lives and others well-being.
